# Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a simple Bash script (`simple-interest.sh`) to calculate 
the simple interest accrued on a principal amount over a certain time at a given 
interest rate. This script is useful for micro-finance computations.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
   
Output:
   simple interest = p*t*r
   
## Usage

```bash
chmod +x simple-interest.sh
./simple-interest.sh <principal> <rate_of_interest> <time_in_years>
